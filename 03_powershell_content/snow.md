# Christmas snow
The snow script does present a snowflakes that fall directly top down and then disappear.
1. Make each snowflake to have a 20% probability not to only fall down but also one position right or left (50%)
2. When a snowflake reaches the bottom it stays there and forms a snow layer. Each additional snowflake stays on the top of underlying one.
3. Adapt the loop in a way that it runs until the whole area is filled with snowflakes.
4. The implementation is not optimised - can you optimise it? The width and length parameters can be extended to provide a bigger calculation field
