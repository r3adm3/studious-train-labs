# Numbers and Decimals

## Working With Fixed Point types

The `Decimal` type is similar to `double`s. They don't have as big a range, but they do have much higher precision.

> What's the range of a decimal type?

#!pwsh

$min = [decimal]::MinValue
$max = [decimal]::MaxValue

"The range of the decimal type is $min to $max"

#!markdown

> How do doubles and decimals compare in precision?

#!pwsh

[double]$a = 1.0
[double]$b = 3.0
$a / $b

[decimal]$c = 1.0
[decimal]$d = 3.0
$c / $d

#!markdown

You can see that a decimals have a higher precision than doubles.

# Playground

Play around with what you've learned! Here's some starting ideas:

> Can you find the area of a circle with a radius of 2.5 inches?
>
> What does the answer look like when you change number types, such as int, short, and decimal.
>
> Hint: You can write `[Math]::PI` as pi, instead of writing the answer out.

#!pwsh

# Define the radius of the circle
$radius = [decimal]2.5

# Calculate the area of the circle using the formula
$area = [Math]::PI * ($radius * $radius)

# Print the result
"The area of the circle is $area inches^2"
#-----------------------------------------------------------

# Define the radius of the circle
$radius = [double]2.5

# Calculate the area of the circle using the formula
$area = [Math]::PI * ($radius * $radius)

# Print the result
"The area of the circle is $area inches^2"
