# Contribute to a repository

1. First check where your repo status `git status`.
   1. Check what branch you are on. If you are not on the branch you want to be (usually `main` or `master`, however you can base your new branch on any existing branch) checkout the correct branch (`git checkout branch_name`).
   2. Check if or what files are changed.
2. Pull the latest remote changes using `git pull`
3. Create you own branch (which is based on your current branch) by doing `git checkout -b branch_name`. 
   1. Follow your company/department/team naming conventions (for instance `feature/feature_name`). The parameter `-b` means create a new branch. 
   2. You can checkout existing branches `git branch -a` where `-a` means all (not only branchs you have worked on previously). When there are many branches the result may be shown in a reader. You can use arrows up and down to scroll and letter `q` to quit the reader.
