## Introduction
This repository contains practical questions and quizzes we have done during the training.
The aim is to provide some record of what have we done so everyone can refresh their memory.
We want to open this repository for everyone to fill in the answers so there is a collection of questions with valid examples of how to answer them.
The answers here do not necessarily present the only option how the particular question can be answered. If you see an alternative answer please feel free to contribute.

## How to contribute
If you find a question which is not answered yet or if you see an alternative answer to existing one feel free to raise a PR (Pull Request).

1. Each question is numbered. To provide an answer add a sub-number with your answer.
   1. This is an example of sub-numbering which could present an answer.
   2. When there are alternative correct answers use multiple sub-numbers.
2. Work on your branch and edit particular `.md` file to provide your answer.
3. Once your answer is done push your branch to the remote repository and raise a PR (Pull Request).
4. Let tutors know about your PR (chase if necessary) and once the review is done merge to the main branch.
5. Repeat until you see a questions where you can add a new answer.
